FIXES

1 - Remove all the force unwraps
2 - Make a decision of what you want to do with the tabs
3 - Make adjustments to the function of saving that we created
4 - Handle the Double on the Request and other details that might break from user input

IMPROVEMENTS

5 - Try to make the json helper more independent if you plan on keeping using it.
6 - On the budget, you could use a mask ( $ 0.00 or $ 000), but it definitely should have maximum one line
